Reaction game using Web MIDI API (Chrome only) and Elm. Done during the Gofore Hagaton 2018.

You need a midi input device to play notes/chords.

This uses first found midi input device by default. You can customize by adding `?device=0` to the url where 0 is the desired index of your device.

In chord mode you can play notes arpeggiated or all at once.
